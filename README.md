## Opinion Mining - Airline Tweets

In this project, we analyze airline tweets of passengers from different major US airlines to predict what sentiments those tweets carry. A tweet can have a positive, negative or neutral sentiment. 

This opinion mining project will provide valuable feedback to airlines to  adopt and implement profitable chanhges that will help their business. 


### What we did
In this project, we created several charts while exploring our datasets to show different aspects of our data like
- number of tweets by airlines, tweets by sentiments, etc
We cleaned the individual tweets and developed classification models to classify these tweets.
We developed machine learning models to accurately determine what sentiment a tweet carries.
